# ios-app-prototype-part

During the Apple Foundation program formation, worked with a team on a io application prototype.
Goal was to have a working naviagation, yet took some times to go a bit further.
Started to developp an information save system with array.

The system isnt fully completed as we only had 10 days to do everything.

Functional 
- modal navigation
- navigationlink
- extracted view usage
- styling with swiftUI
- database for logic operation

Lot of rework would be necessary
