# ios-app-prototype-part

During the Apple Foundation program formation, worked with a team on a io application prototype.
Goal was to have a working naviagation, yet took some times to go a bit further.
Started to developp an information save system with array.

The system isnt fully completed as we only had 10 days to do everything.

The modal navigation is functional, so the navigationlink.
Somes rework would be necessary
